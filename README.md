# sorting-mini-project
As the name suggests, it's our mini-project for the sorting lab.


Acknoledgements
I asked Peter for help on figuring out why my MergeSort works on integers, but not the same ordered strings. We weren't able to figure it out.
For MergeSort and Quicksort, I used the stub methods provided in the respective labs from SamR. I also used some of the code that Marina A. and I worked on for merging in MergeSort.
